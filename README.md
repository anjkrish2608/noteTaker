## Description of Application

## Technologies Used
While creating this application I have used many different technologies listed below:

* Express Package: to start and run the server
* Path Package: to form html routes
* Util Package: to promisfy async functions

## Challenges Faced
In this homework I have faced many challenges, initially I was unable to complete due to lack of understanding of routes. I have since overcome this which is shown through the established html and api routes in this application.

## Features to be Implemented
In the future I would like to fix the errors which are currently present in the application.
